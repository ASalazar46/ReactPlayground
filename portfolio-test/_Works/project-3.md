As a requirement of the engineering curriculum, all engineering students are to undergo a series of projects through out their sophomore, junior, and senior years here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. These projects are labeled as EE/ENGR 296, 396, and 496, respectively. For this project, EE396 and EE496, the goal is to convert the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus into a 100% renewable energy campus. Specifically, our project focuses on the collection and analysis of weather data. To achieve this, there are multiple teams dedicated to designing weatherboxes that collect the weather data. There are also multiple teams dedicated to developing the software for the project's data server and the project's dashboard.

I was assigned the role of dashboard member. My objective as this role is to develop the front-end and back-end software of the project's dashboard. This means that my group handles how data retrieved from the weatherboxes is displayed, create graphs and charts from such data, and analyze the data. The main languages to learn for this project are Javascript, HTML, and CSS. However, in the future we will need to learn Python and SQL for the back-end. This project will develop my teamworking and communication skills, as well as deepen my experiences in programming.
