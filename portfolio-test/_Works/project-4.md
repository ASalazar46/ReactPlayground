*The landing page to Beyond The Library web application*

The main purpose of this web application is to assist students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to search for study spots around campus. The two libraries on campus, Sinclair Library and Hamilton Library, are go-to spots to study and, at times, could get crowded. This app lists spots around campus, and has a map with a collection of markers denoting the locations of study spots. Users, if logged in, can also submit study spots. These spots can then be reviewwed by an admin to add it to the list or reject it.

As for my contribution to the project, I created the Discovery page, where all the verified study spots are listed, and designed the filter for it. I also worked on the user profile page as best as I could. 

The lessons to take away from this project are important. I learned how to design applications using the Meteor app framework. I learned how to make changes to the project's source code with the IntelliJ IDEA IDE, and learned how to publish those changes to the repository on GitHub. From this, I then learned how to run our code (it is a simple one line command input to the console) and test it locally for functionality. As for working in a team, I became better at coordinating issues with my team mates. When I had become stuck my teammates would help as best as they could to resolve what issue I had with the code, and I would do the same for them. While this is my first experience with software engineering in a while, this experience has been fruitful despite the setbacks in application features.
