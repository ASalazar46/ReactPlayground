## Overview
  The problem: Many UH Manoa students commute from home to school. Unfortunately, traffic in the morning is super super bad. 
  The solution: The "UH-ber" application will enable UH Manoa students to organize car-pools. Students can log-in and see if anyone in
  their area can give them a ride.
