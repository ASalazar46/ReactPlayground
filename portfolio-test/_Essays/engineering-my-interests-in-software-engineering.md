Looking back to my earliest memories of me sitting at the computer and using it, I think about two things.

The first thing that I think about is how far computer hardware has advanced since the late 1990s to present day. The first computer that I used was small Dell tower, powered by an older model of an Intel Pentium processor, a now-long-outdated Nvidia Vanta graphics card, and 20 gigabytes of hard drive storage, running Windows ME.  Fast-forwarding to today, I now use a laptop with a 4-core Intel i7 processor clocked at 2.5 gigahertz, AMD Radeon R7 M460 graphics, and 250 gigabytes of solid state drive storage, with an extra 1 terabyte of external storage. In any case, it is apparent how far hardware has advanced since my first exposure to computers.

The second thing I think about is how far computer software has advanced. The games that I played on that dinosaur of a machine were limited to just flash games found on Real Arcade or on the internet. The games I can play on this bad boy of a laptop is almost unlimited, from the simple flash games found on the internet to the AAA games produced in the present day (albeit at either low to medium settings for a decent framerate). Not just games, but actual applications saw major advancements. For example: Google. It went from being just a web search engine to something a lot more than that (Email servicer (gmail), cloud manager (google drive), and productivity (docs, slides, sheets), and etc.)

Now how does my memories of computers and its rapid advancement relate to an interest in software engineering? The point of my analysis was that I have had a wonderful childhood. It was wonderful because of all the good times and experiences I had and am having when using a computer. I only wish to be apart of the team that will produce the next best piece of software or hardware. That way, children can experience what I once experienced when I was a child and enjoy it as much as I do. To do so, I am studying for a degree in computer engineering, which is the best of both electrical engineering (computer hardware) and software engineering (computer software).
