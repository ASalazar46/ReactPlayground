This is a work in progress online portfolio using Javascript, React, Node.js/Express.js, and Tailwind CSS. 
To-Dos for this project:
- Make a layout for the Essay tab (DONE)
- Make a layout for the Works tab (DONE)
- Display essay files in their own page
- Display works/projects files in their own page
- Make a layout for the Resume tab
- Make a layout for the About Me tab
    - Things I could add:
        -- A logo and/or catchphrase/line/thing
        -- Relevant Skills (hard/technical and soft/interpersonal/transferable)
        -- Education & school-related things
        -- Biography/shareable, personal details
- Find inspiration for a more modern design (it currently looks like a page from the 90s)
- Eventually replace template placeholders with actual profile details
