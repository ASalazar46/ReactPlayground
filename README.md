This is a repository for messing around with React.

Works so far:
- Tic Tac Toe react tutorial (need to add suggested additions, as requested at end of tutorial)
- Dashboard redux (from my capstone projects, but redone here and not in a private school repo)
- Portfolio test (I have access to a pre-made online portfolio that makes it easy to make an online portfolio, but I wanted to make my own, so that is what this is)
